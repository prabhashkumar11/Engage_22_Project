#### This is my Entry for Microsoft Engage'22 under the Category of Face Recognition for Smarter Advertising
- I created this Deep learning Web App Face Products Recommendation System for MS Engage program 2022. The Website is fully functional and useable in real life for both users and advertising companies.This is easy to use . The Agile Scrum Methodology has heavily influenced my work in the past 1 month. I divided my whole task into four weeks. I started completing my tasks as sprint wise that helped in smooth learning and building project.

## Running the Web App on your Local Device

- To run the web app in your local device, run the following commands in your terminal (macOS) or command prompt (Windows) :-
Clone the GitHub repository into your local device by running the following command:
```

cd folder-you-want-to-download-code-in

git clone https://github.com/prabhashkumar11/Engage_22_Project.git

cd Engage_22_Project

```
- Now that you're in the project folder, open terminal to download the necessaries libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
- Now run the server by running following command
```
streamlit run app.py

```
- For Using Web App Upload Images from Test Image folder
```
  Test Image/
```
## Technologies Used

1. Python

2. Tensorflow

3. openCV

4. Numpy

5. Streamlit

6. CSS

## In this Fast pacing world, Advertise the Right Product at the Right time is necessary.

### Challenge
Develop a browser-based application or a native mobile application to demonstrate application of Face Recognition technology.
Example - Smarter Advertising

**I sucessfully implemented the Feature of Smarter Advertising under the Application of Face Recognition.**
- Web App will Recommend Face Products(face wash) according to Users Face Skin type. For Recommendation User need to upload their face Image and App will provide Recommendations and link to the products.
- This Web app will also handle case of When user uploaded image other than face image. It will give message to upload the image of Face.

### What I Accomplished

## Future Possible Functionalities

1. Add a signup/authentican page
2. Improve upon the Adapt functionality in the web app.
3. Recommending more different types of Products based on other qualities

## Sprint sheet of day to day task by using Aglie methodology:

### Week1
- Decided Tech Stack and Problem Statement.
- Explored Agile Methodology
- Learned Basics of Python and Tensorflow 
### Week 2
- Research on libraries what will be required
- Learned Basics of Image Processing
- worked on detecting faces using opencv harcascade
### Week 3
- Learned Basics of Deep learning and Neural Networks
- Worked on CNN Architure building for Image classification
- Trained Images use CNN Model Architure
- Learned basics of Streamlit

### Week 4
- Built Fontend to serve the Model using Streamlit.
- Making of Video for Demo, documentation on github
